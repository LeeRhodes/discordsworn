**__Ask the Oracle__**
_Asks the Oracle_ for inspiration.
__Yes/No Questions__
To _Ask_ a Yes/No question, start with the `oracle` command and then an Odds keyword. Then, optionally, add a description:
```.oracle unlikely Will this work?```
_Ask_ the same question, but with a different command name and abbreviated Odds keyword:
```.ask ul Will this work?```
_Ask_ the same question, but with no description, the shortest command name, and the numeric equivalent of the Unlikely keyword (25%):
```.o 25```
__Tables__
To consult an _Oracle_ table, start with the `oracle` command, then the word `table`, then the keyword for the table you wish to consult:
```.oracle table elf-names```
You can abbreviate `oracle` and `table` to `o` and `t`, respectively, and each table has its own shorthand:
```.o t en```
_Table Names:_
    __A__ction, __T__heme, __R__egion, __L__ocation, __C__oastal __W__aters __L__ocation, __L__ocation __D__escriptors, __S__ettlement __N__ames, __Q__uick __S__ettlement __N__ames, __S__ettlement __T__rouble, __N__PC __R__oles, __G__oals, __N__PC __D__escriptors, __I__ronlander __N__ames, __E__lf __N__ames, __O__ther __N__ames, __C__ombat __A__ctions, __M__ystic __B__acklash, __M__ajor __P__lot __T__wist, __C__hallenge __R__ank

_(Homebrew):
    _ __I__nciting __S__ituations, __G__ender __P__resentation and __I__dentity

Underlined letters indicate the abbreviation for a table: `cwl`
 When specifying tables with multiple words, replace spaces with dashes: `coastal-waters-location`
Terms can be lowercase, but need not be:
```.ORACLE TABLE Coastal-Waters-Location```

**__Ironsworn Action Roll__**
Performs an Action Roll from the _Ironsworn_ engine.

To perform an Action Roll, simply use the `ironsworn-action` command or one of its aliases. You may include any number of whole numbers, which will be counted as modifiers. Text is ignored, which allows you to add a description to your rolls:
```.ironsworn-action Rolling to Compel the guard to let me pass by telling him I have business with the Prince. +2 Shadow and +1 for my Secure Advantage.```
The command has a few aliases (`is`, `act`, and `a`). All you need are the numeric modifiers; the text is purely for flavour. All aliases function exactly the same:
```.is Compelling the guard by lying: +2 Shadow, +1 Secure Advantage```
```.act Compel +2 s +1 SA```
`+`'s can be omitted, as well as any text:
```.a 2 1```
You can put as much text, and as many modifiers, into a roll as Discord's 2,000-character limit will allow.

**__Apocalypse World Move Roll__**
Performs a Move roll from the _Apocalypse World_ engine.

To perform a Move, simply use the `apocalypse-world-move` command or one of its aliases. You may include any number of whole numbers, which will be counted as modifiers. Text is ignored, which allows you to add a description to your rolls:
```.apocalypse-world-move Rolling to Manipulate the guard to let me pass by telling him I have business with the gang leader. +2 Hot and +1 Forward from earlier.```
The command has a few aliases (`aw`, `move`, and `m`). All you need are the numeric modifiers; the text is purely for flavour. All aliases function exactly the same:
```.aw Manipulating the guard by lying: +2 Hot, +1 Forward```
```.move Manipulate +2 h +1 F```
`+`'s can be omitted, as well as any text:
```.m 2 1```
You can put as much text, and as many modifiers, into a roll as Discord's 2,000-character limit will allow.
